  <h1>Her Journey — From Dreams to Dedication</h1>

  <blockquote>“Behind every white coat is a story of <strong>dreams</strong>, <strong>sacrifice</strong>, and unbreakable resolve.”</blockquote>

  <section>
    <h2>The Childhood Dream</h2>
    <p>Ever since she was a little girl, Laraib knew she was meant to heal. Inspired by <strong>compassion</strong> and driven by <strong>curiosity</strong>, she dreamed of wearing a <b>white coat</b> and serving humanity. Her journey into medicine began with a simple wish — to make lives better.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The First Step</h2>
    <p>Years of dedication and hard work led her to her first major milestone — appearing in the MDCAT exam. On her very first attempt, she gave it her all… but despite her best efforts, she couldn’t secure admission into a government medical college.</p>
    <p>It was a <b>heartbreaking moment</b> — the kind that tests your <strong>dreams</strong> and shakes your <strong>spirit</strong>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Solace in Faith</h2>
    <p>In the quiet moments after her first attempt, when the world felt heavy and <strong>dreams</strong> seemed distant, she found solace in these sacred words. This ayat echoed in her heart, reminding her that <strong>patience</strong>, <strong>faith</strong>, and <strong>resilience</strong> are never wasted. With every verse, she gathered hope and strength to rise again — and today, her journey stands as a testament to unwavering determination and the power of trust in Allah's plan.</p>
